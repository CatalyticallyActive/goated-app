## Features

### Picture-in-Picture Mode

The GoatedAI floating bar now supports Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode using the Document Picture-in-Picture API. When you click "Start GoatedAI":

1. **Screen Sharing**: The browser prompts you to select a screen, window, or tab to share
2. **PiP Window**: A compact Picture-in-Picture window opens that stays on top of other applications
3. **Always Visible**: The PiP window remains visible even when you click elsewhere on your desktop
4. **Compact Interface**: Optimized layout for the small PiP window with category buttons and AI insights
5. **Easy Close**: Click the Ã— button in the top-right corner to close the PiP window

**Browser Support**: The PiP feature works in modern browsers that support the Document Picture-in-Picture API. For unsupported browsers, it falls back to a regular popup window.
